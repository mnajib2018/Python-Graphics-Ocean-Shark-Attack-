#Final Project: Deadly Shark Attack
#By Muhammad Najib
#Preview of game
#As a deadly Shark, you have to eat all the fish in the pond,
#Move arrow keys to move the shark. If purple fish is eaten, two yellow fishes are born,
#If a yellow fish is eaten, a starfish is born, but eating starfish doesnÂ´t result in a new fish
#Each fish is worth 10 points. Game ends once all fishes have been eaten.
